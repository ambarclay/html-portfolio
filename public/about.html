<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! My name is Angelena, and I am learning how to be a Web Developer. I started my journey
  learning coding back when I was in high school, taking a short class at a local college
  introducing me to Python. I then went on to study Computer Engineering in college, but I dropped
  out and switched majors before I could learn much. I went on to earn my Bachelors of Science in
  Music degree from Nazareth College in 2020.
</p>

<p>
  After graduating (during a global pandemic no less) I worked in a bakery and then started working
  as a Notetaker for deaf and hard-of-hearing students, which I am still doing. During my free time
  I began taking online classes about web design and development, rekindling my interest in coding
  and leading me to today!
</p>

<p>
  I hope that through taking classes and learning more about web design and development I will be
  able to create beautiful websites and help others in designing and creating their websites. It
  would be a dream if I was able to have my own business as a web developer, so I have decided that
  that is the goal I am working towards. It may be a distant dream, but I am confident that I will
  be able to make it happen.
